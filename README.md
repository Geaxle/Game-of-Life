# Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life made with Python and the Libtcod rogue library.

Though the project is shown as written in C, the part I wrote is in Python and is only the "game of life.py" file. The C bits is from the library.

This is the standard Conway's Game of Life. The field is an infinite torus (they will loop from one edge to the oposite edge).

This is a project I wrote very early when learning programming as a way to developp my python skills.
